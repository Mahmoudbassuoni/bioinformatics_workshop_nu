# Bioinformatics_Workshop_NU
A bioinformatics tutorial on alignment and variant calling and how to extract the Operational Taxonimc Units (OTU) out of Bacterial Fastq files.

## Part [1]: Docker Installation and Image start
**All tools needed was downloaded and installed on a docker image for anyone to be able to reproduce the same data without errors**
### 1.1 Download Docker
#### 1. Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
```    
#### 2.Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:
```
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```
#### 3.Use the following command to set up the repository:
```
$ echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```
### 1.2 Install Docker Engine
#### 1.Update the apt package index:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
```
#### 2.Install Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose. 
```
$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-composE. Coli K12 is a common laboratory strain that has lost its ability to live in the human intestine, but is ideal for manipulation in a controlled setting. The genome is relatively short, and so it's a good place to start learning about alignment and variant calling.e-plugin
```
#### 3.Verify that the Docker Engine installation is successful by running the hello-world image:
```
$ sudo docker run hello-world
```
### 1.3 Install our tutorial docker image
```
$ sudo docker pull mahmoudbassyouni/bioinformatics_workshop_nu:v2
```
### 1.4 Run the docker image
```
$ sudo docker run -it -v $HOME:$HOME mahmoudbassyouni/bioinformatics_workshop_nu:v2
```
## Part [2]: Aligning E. Coli data with bwa mem
[E. Coli K12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli#Model_organism) is a common laboratory strain that has lost its ability to live in the human intestine, but is ideal for manipulation in a controlled setting. The genome is relatively short, and so it's a good place to start learning about alignment and variant calling. 
### 2.1 E. Coli K12 reference
We'll get some test data to play with. First, [the E. Coli K12 reference](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/556503834), from NCBI. It's a bit of a pain to pull out of the web interface so [you can also download it here](http://hypervolu.me/~erik/genomes/E.coli_K12_MG1655.fa).
